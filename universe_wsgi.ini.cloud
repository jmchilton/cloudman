#
# By default, Galaxy manages and executes jobs from within a single process and

# and job_handlers from their default values, notification will instead be done
# using the `state` and `handler` columns of the job table in the database.

# Identify the server_name (the string following server: at the top of this
# file) which should be designated as the job manager (only one):
#job_manager = main

# (responsible for starting, tracking, finishing, and cleaning up jobs) as a
# comma-separated list.

# By default, a handler from job_handlers will be selected at random if the
# tool to run does specify a handler below in [galaxy:tool_handlers].  If you
# want certain handlers to only handle jobs for tools/params explicitly
# assigned below, use default_job_handlers to specify which handlers should be
# used for jobs without explicit handlers.
#default_job_handlers = main

# In multiprocess configurations, notification between processes about new jobs
# is done via the database.  In single process configurations, this is done in
# memory, which is a bit quicker.  Galaxy tries to automatically determine
# which method it should used based on your manager/handler configuration
# above, but can't reliably determine if you have multiple processes for web
# servers but only a single process as a manager/handler.  In that scenario,
# you can override the tracking method by setting the following to True:

# ---- Per-Tool Job Management ----------------------------------------------

# Per-tool job handler and runner overrides. Parameters can be included to define multiple
# runners per tool. E.g. to run Cufflinks jobs initiated from Trackster
# differently than standard Cufflinks jobs:
#
#   cufflinks = local:///
#   cufflinks[source@trackster] = local:///

[galaxy:tool_handlers]

# By default, Galaxy will select a handler at random from the list of
# job_handlers set above.  You can override as in the following examples:
#
#upload1 = upload_handler
#cufflinks[source@trackster] = realtime_handler

[galaxy:tool_runners]

# If not listed here, a tool will run with the runner defined with
# default_cluster_job_runner.  These overrides for local:/// are done because
# these tools can fetch data from remote sites, which may not be suitable to
# run on a cluster (if it does not have access to the Internet, for example).

biomart = local:///
encode_db1 = local:///
hbvar = local:///
microbial_import1 = local:///
ucsc_table_direct1 = local:///
ucsc_table_direct_archaea1 = local:///
ucsc_table_direct_test1 = local:///
upload1 = local:///

# ---- Galaxy Message Queue -------------------------------------------------

# Galaxy uses AMQ protocol to receive messages from external sources like
# bar code scanners. Galaxy has been tested against RabbitMQ AMQP implementation.
# For Galaxy to receive messages from a message queue the RabbitMQ server has
# to be set up with a user account and other parameters listed below. The 'host'
# and 'port' fields should point to where the RabbitMQ server is running.
